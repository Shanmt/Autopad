1. Cannot register more than ones with a Service Station Name or Contact Number
The service checks whether the contact number exist, if yes, it should take them to the login or show alert on login 
AS of now, i am giving a credit of 50 SMS to new registrants. 

2. getVerified will verify the contact and passcode and return the details as below. 
/getVerified?contactnumber=8606889900&Passcode=8662
if success it will return on Success 
{
  "result": [
    {
      "userid": "549d600d-e45b-11e5-b657-fcaa1492285f",
      "servicestationid": "549d6070-e45b-11e5-b657-fcaa1492285f",
      "contactperson": "joshy"
    }
  ]
}
and on failure 
{
  "result": []
}

4. Added stored procedure checklogin(contact, passcode)
